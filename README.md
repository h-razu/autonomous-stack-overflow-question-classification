# autonomous-stack-overflow-question-classification

This project focuses on developing an autonomous tagging system for <b><i>Stack Overflow</i></b> question. Currently, users manually enter tags for their questions, which can be inaccurate
 or insufficient. To address this issue, we applied machine learning
 methods such as <i>Logistic Regression</i>, <i>SGD Classifier</i>, <i>Multinomial
 NB</i>, and <i>Random Forest</i>, along with essential data preprocessing
 techniques. The evaluation of models shows that <i>Logistic Regression</i> is performing better than others. The <i>SGD classifier</i>
 also has a satisfactory performance.
